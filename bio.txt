go backs to the heather video and write a few notes about what to put in my bio here:

1) Identify your audience: bio will be more in depth in website than your social media.
2) Powerful first sentence: Describe who you are and what your 
auidence can expect from you.
3) Tell a compelling story: Telling a story about your greates accomplishments. 
4) Create a call to action: sharing your website or show them what socail you are most on. 
5) Show some personality: helping audience relate to you.
