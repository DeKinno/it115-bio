Hello, my name is Esau Guzman. 
I am enrolled in the Year Up program in the Quality assurance Track.
I am excited to learn Software development and learn coding languages on the way!
I have a goal to emerge as a professional and pick up more knowledge during the year.
I am willing to push past my limits to become a developer and create applications and also test the application!
I enjoy deadlifting in my freetime!
